# Spring-Boot-Todo-Backend

Basic Todo App Spring Boot API set up with JWT auth. 

Other than some small refactoring amd minor additions all of the .jwt and .jwt.resource packages code is from a Udemy course that I went through.

#### You can check out the frontend [here](https://github.com/bal360/springboot-todo-frontend).
