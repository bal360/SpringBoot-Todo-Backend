# SpringBoot-Todo-Backend

This is a Spring Boot API that is set up to be accessed from this frontend app [here](https://github.com/bal360/springboot-todo-frontend).

Other than some small refactoring amd minor additions all of the .jwt and .jwt.resource packages code is from a Udemy course that I went through. I am currently diving deep into all things Spring Security and will be learning every step of Spring Boot JWT set up, but for now I am using these packages to get started quickly.
