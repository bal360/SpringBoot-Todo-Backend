# Spring-Boot-Todo-Backend

Basic Todo App Spring Boot API set up with JWT auth. 

Other than some small refactoring amd minor additions all of the .jwt and .jwt.resource packages code is from a Udemy course that I went through. I am currently diving deep into all things Spring Security and will be learning every step of Spring Boot JWT set up, but for now I am using these packages to get started quickly.
